# Broadcom-MASTERS

Broadcom MASTERS machine learning project. Uses I2C and KMeans to retrieve and process data respectively, and uses graphene supercapacitors as a power source for various motors and lights. By using only enough energy to power lights through an observed and deduced predetermined amount of time, his program requires less energy and therefore can use smaller solar panels to power a home and less hazardous materials can be used in production of solar panels. Requires berryconda3 and I2C compatible machines.
